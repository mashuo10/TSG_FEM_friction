% This function gives the prestress design of tensegrity, consider boundary
% constraints and group constraints, given deisgned force( vector with
% number of prestress modes entries)
% 
% Inputs:
%   Gp: group matrix of members
%   l: members' length vector
%   H: members' direction matrix
%	A_1ag: Equilirium matrix with boundary, group constraints, force density as variable.
%   V2: prestress mode
%   w0a: external force in free nodal coordinate
%   index_gp: number of groups with designed force
%   fd: force of designed groups
%
% Outputs:
%	q_gp: force desity vector in group
%	t_gp: force vector in group
%	q: force desity vector 
%	t: force vector
