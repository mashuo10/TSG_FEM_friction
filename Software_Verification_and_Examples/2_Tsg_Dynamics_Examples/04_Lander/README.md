This folder has one M file, 'Example_lander.m', conducting pseudThis file contains two M files:

1. The 'main_lander.m' is the main function for the falling and bouncing analysis of an expanded octahedron.  
2. The 'w_t_ground_force.m' is the called function to calculate the bouncing force given by the ground.  

If the user wants to re-run or check other examples, go and run 'main_lander.m'.    
The result will be stored in the 'FEM_lander_linear_elastic.mat' file.
