% This function output the time history of external force and ground motion  
%
% Inputs:
%   G: gravity force 
%	dz_d_t: displacement of ground motion with time
%	dz_v_t: velocity of ground motion with time
%   dz_a_t: acceleration of ground motion with time
%   move_ground: % for earthquake, use pinned nodes motion(1) 
%   or add inertia force in free node(0) 
%
% Outputs:
%   w_t: time history of external force
%   dnb_t: displacement of pinned nodes
%   dnb_d_t: velocity of pinned nodes
%   dnb_dd_t: acceleration of pinned nodes
