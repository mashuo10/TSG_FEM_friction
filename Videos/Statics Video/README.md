Here, five videos of static analysis are shown:

1. tower:
 -  '01_tower_compression.gif' is the static analysis of a two layer tensegrity prism in compression force on the three top nodes.
 - '01_tower_tension.gif' is the static analysis of a two layer tensegrity prism in tension force on the three top nodes.\
 2. 3D_Dbar
 - '02_3D-Dbar.gif' is the pseduo static analysis of a 3D_Dbar with rest length changing.
3. lander
- '03_lander.gif' is the static analysis of a expanded octahedron tensegrity with rest length of one string changing.
4. Jasen_linkage
- '04_Jasen_linkage.gif' is the pseudo static analysis of a truss system, Jasen linkage. The Jasen linkage is actuated by forced motion of some nodes.
5. Cable dome 
- '05_cable_dome.gif' is the static analysis of a Levy cable dome in vertical load exerting on every top nodes.
6. Half T-bar
- '06_half_Tbar_linear_elastic_slack_1.gif' is the static analysis of a half_Tbar considering slack of string.
- '06_half_Tbar_linear_elastic_slack_0.gif' is the static analysis of a half_Tbar not considering slack of string.
