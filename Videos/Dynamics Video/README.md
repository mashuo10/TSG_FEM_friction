Here, five dynamics videos are shown:

1. tower:
 -  '01_tower_inertia_force.gif' is the dynamic analysis of a two-layer tensegrity prism in ground motion(ground acceleration is equivalent to inertia force on free nodes).
 - '01_tower_ground_motion.gif' is the dynamic analysis of a two-layer tensegrity prism in ground motion(ground acceleration is exerted directly on pinned nodes).
 2. cantilever_truss
 -  '02_cantilever_truss_elastic.gif' is the video of the cantilever truss with elastic material.
 -  '02_cantilever_truss_multielastic.gif' is the video of the cantilever truss with multilinear elastic material.
 - '02_cantilever_truss_plastic.gif' is the video of the cantilever truss with plastic material.
 - '02_stress_strain_linear_elastic.gif' is the stress-strain curve with elastic material
 - '02_stress_strain_blin.gif' is the stress-starin curve with bilinear material.
 - '02_stress_strain_plastic.gif' is the stress-strain curve with plastic material.
 3. double_pendulum
 - '03_double_pendulum.gif' is the video of the double pendulum.
 4. Lander
 - '04_lander.gif' is the video of the expandend octahedron tensegrity.
 5. T_bar
 - '05_Tbar.gif' is the video of the planner T-bar structure with initial velocity.
